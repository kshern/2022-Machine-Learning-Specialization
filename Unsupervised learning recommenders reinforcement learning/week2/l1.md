Welcome to this second to last week of he machine learning specialization. I'm really happy that together, almost all the way to the finish line. What we'll do this week is discuss recommended systems. This is one of the topics that has received quite a bit of attention in academia. But the commercial impact and the actual number of practical use cases of recommended systems seems to me to be even vastly greater than the amount of attention it has received in academia. Every time you go to an online shopping website like Amazon or a movie streaming sites like Netflix or go to one of the apps or sites that do food delivery. 
Many of these sites will recommend things o you that they think you may want to buy or movies they think you may want to watch or restaurants that they think you may want to try out. And for many companies, a large fraction of sales is driven by their recommended systems. So today for many companies, the economics or the value driven by recommended systems is very large and so what we're doing this week is take a look at how they work. So with that let's dive in and take a look at what is a recommended system. I'm going to use as a running example, the application of predicting movie ratings. So say you run a large movie streaming website and your users have rated movies using one to five stars.
And so in a typical recommended system you have a set of users, here we have four users Alice, Bob Carol and Dave. Which have numbered users 1,2,3,4. As well as a set of movies Love at last, Romance forever, Cute puppies of love and then Nonstop car chases and Sword versus karate. And what the users have done is rated hese movies one to five stars. Or in fact to make some of these examples a little bit easier. I'm not going to let them rate he movies from zero to five stars. So say Alice has rated Love and last five stars, Romance forever five stars.
 
Maybe she has not yet watched cute puppies of love so you don't have a rating for that. And I'm going to denote that via a question mark and she thinks nonstop car chases and sword versus karate deserve zero stars bob. Race at five stars has not watched that, so you don't have a rating race at four stars, 0,0. Carol on the other hand, hings that deserve zero stars has not watched that zero stars and she loves nonstop car chases and swords versus karate and Dave raise the movies as follows. In the typical recommended system, you have some number of users as well as some number of items. In this case the items are movies that you want to recommend to the users. And even though I'm using movies in this example, the same logic or the same thing.
Work for recommending anything from products or website myself to restaurants, to even which media articles, he social media articles to show, to the user that may be more interesting for them. The notation I'm going to use is I'm going o use nu to denote the number of users. So in this example nu is equal to four because you have four users and nm to denote the number of movies or really the number of items. So in this example nm is equal to five because we have five movies. I'm going to set r(i,j)=1, if user j has rated movie i. So for example, use a one Dallas Alice has rated movie one but has not rated movie three and so r(1,1) =1, because she has rated movie one, but r( 3,1)=0 because she has not rated movie number three. Then finally I'm going to use y(i,j). J to denote the rating given by user j to movie i. So for example, this rating here would be that movie three was rated by user 2 to be equal to four. 

Notice that not every user rates every movie and it's important for the system to know which users have rated which movies. That's why we're going to define r(i,j)=1 if user j has rated movie i and will be equal to zero if user j has not rated movie i. So with this framework for recommended systems one possible way to approach the problem is to look at the movies hat users have not rated. And to try to predict how users would rate those movies because then we can try to recommend to users things that they are more likely to rate as five stars. And in the next video we'll start o develop an algorithm for doing exactly that. But making one very special assumption. Which is we're going to assume temporarily hat we have access to features or extra information about the movies such as which movies are romance movies, which movies are action movies. And using that will start o develop an algorithm. But later this week will actually come back and ask what if we don't have these features, how can you still get the algorithm to work then? But let's go on to the next video to start building up this algorithm.
 
欢迎来到机器学习专项课程的倒数第二周。我很高兴我们几乎一起走到了终点。本周我们将讨论推荐系统。这是一个在学术界受到了相当多关注的主题。但是，推荐系统的商业影响和实际应用案例的数量似乎远远大于其在学术界获得的关注。每当您访问像亚马逊这样的在线购物网站，或者像Netflix这样的电影流媒体网站，或者使用一些提供食品送餐服务的应用或网站时。
许多这些网站会向您推荐它们认为您可能想购买的物品，或者它们认为您可能想观看的电影，或者它们认为您可能想尝试的餐厅。对于许多公司来说，推荐系统推动了它们大部分的销售额。因此，对于许多公司来说，推荐系统带来的经济效益或价值是非常大的。因此，本周我们将深入了解它们是如何工作的。让我们先来看一下什么是推荐系统。我将以预测电影评分的应用为例进行解释。假设您经营一个大型电影流媒体网站，您的用户对电影进行了一到五星的评价。
在一个典型的推荐系统中，我们有一组用户，这里有四个用户Alice、Bob、Carol和Dave，分别编号为1、2、3、4。还有一组电影，包括《最后的爱情》、《永恒的浪漫》、《可爱的爱情小狗》、《无尽的汽车追逐》和《剑与空手道》。用户对这些电影进行了一到五星的评价。为了简化一些示例，我不让他们对电影进行从零到五星的评价。假设Alice给《最后的爱情》评了五星，给《永恒的浪漫》评了五星。
也许她还没有观看过《可爱的爱情小狗》，所以您没有对该电影的评价。我将用一个问号表示，而她认为《无尽的汽车追逐》和《剑与空手道》应该评为零星。Bob对《赛车》没有评分，因为他还没有观看过，所以您没有该电影的评分，用0表示。Carol则认为《零星》不值得评分，因为她还没有观看过。她喜欢《无尽的汽车追逐》和《剑与空手道》。Dave对电影的评分如下。在典型的推荐系统中，您有一些用户和一些物品。在这种情况下，物品是您想向用户推荐的电影。即使我在这个例子中使用的是电影，逻辑和概念都是相同的。
推荐的范围可以涵盖从产品、网站自身到餐馆，甚至包括哪些媒体文章、社交媒体文章对用户来说可能更有趣。我将使用符号来表示：使用ν表示用户的数量。因此，在这个例子中，ν等于4，因为有四个用户；使用nm表示电影的数量，或者更广义地说，物品的数量。所以在这个例子中，nm等于5，因为我们有五部电影。我将设置r(i,j)=1，如果用户j给电影i评过分。例如，用户一Alice给电影一评过分，但没有给电影三评过分，所以r(1,1)=1，因为她给电影一评过分，但r(3,1)=0，因为她没有给电影三评过分。最后，我将使用y(i,j)来表示用户j给电影i的评分。例如，这个评分表示用户2给电影三评了4分。
请注意，并不是每个用户都对每部电影进行评分，系统知道哪些用户对哪些电影进行了评分是很重要的。因此，我们将定义r(i,j)=1，如果用户j对电影i进行了评分，并且如果用户j没有对电影i进行评分，那么r(i,j)将等于零。因此，在推荐系统的框架下，一种可能的方法是研究用户没有评分的电影，并尝试预测用户对这些电影的评分，因为这样我们就可以尝试向用户推荐他们更有可能评为五星的事物。在接下来的视频中，我们将开始开发一个完全符合这个目标的算法。但是我们会做一个非常特殊的假设。我们暂时假设我们可以访问关于电影的特征或额外信息，比如哪些电影是浪漫电影，哪些电影是动作片。利用这些信息，我们将开始开发一个算法。但是在本周晚些时候，我们将回过头来问，如果没有这些特征，你如何使算法仍然有效？但是现在让我们继续下一个视频，开始构建这个算法。
